2 Player battleship game played in a terminal

after every turn, delay before screen is wiped and next player makes their move

at it's basic concept, players fill a grid with shapes, then take turns guessing grid coordinates to see if there's a shape there

needed objects
play area
    - has a size (assume it's always square?)
        - list of list? I.E. a 2x2 grid is a [[0, 1], [0,1]]
        - each grid is either ocupied, or not
        - each grid is guessed, or not
        - if a grid is guessed, the contents of the grid is known.
        so each grid segment, i need to know what it holds and if the other player has guessed it to do everything with it.

        how should a grid be structured? Let's take a 3x3 grid as an example
        play area =
        [[grid, grid, grid], 
         [grid, grid, grid],
         [grid, grid, grid]]

        play area[0,1].get status = 
    - is tied to a player

grid segment
    - has a contents (empty, or occupied)
    - has a status (fired or not)
    - has a name ('E4')



to display the play area I can iterate through the play area

so assuming I'm player 1, my board would look like
    
    for row in play_area:
        for grid in row:
            print grid.contents

my enemies board would look like

    for row in play_area:
        for grid in row:
            if grid.status = fired:
                print grid.contents
            else:
                print whatever we want for a grid we haven't shot at 

General game flow

setup
    players have a set of pieces
    players indicate where they want the piece to start/end
    one player will completely place their pieces, then hand it over to another player to do the same
    once all players are done, the game phase begins

game
    at the beginning of each players turn, ask for them to hit a key to display their board status
    once confirmed, the players' board as well as what they know of the enemies board is displayed
    the player is asked which coordinate they want to fire at (ex. "E4")
    we check the contents of the enemy player's coordinate and update the board
    when they are finished, they hit a key to clear the screen and give control over to the next player.

conclusion
    when one player has no remaining ships, they lose the game
    if a player discovers the last spot, they receive a message saying they won
    the game asks if they'd like to play another or quit the program
